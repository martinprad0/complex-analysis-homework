\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{theorem}[Parseval's Identity]
    For any function $f\in L_2(-\pi, \pi)$, with Fourier series expansion
    \[ f(x) = \sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{inx},\mbox{ where }c_n = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) e^{-inx} dx, \]
    we have that
    \[ \sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} |c_n|^2 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi |f(x)|^2 dx .\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Weierstrass factorization theorem]
    Let $f: U \to \C$ be a holomorphic function, let $m$ be the multiplicity of 0 as a zero of $f$ and let $(a_n)_{n\in \N}$ be a (infinite) sequence with the zeros of $f$, each zero being in the sequence as many times as its multiplicity.

    Now, let $(p_n)_{n\in\N}$ be a sequence of positive integers such that for any $r \in \R$
    \[ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left| \frac{r}{a_n} \right|^{p_n + 1} < \infty. \]
    It follows that if
    \[ E_{p}(z) = (1-z)\cdot \exp\left( \underbrace{1+z+\frac{z^2}{2}+\cdots+\frac{z^n}{n}}_{\approx - \log (1-z)} \right), \] 
    then, the function $z \mapsto \prod_{n = 1}^{\infty} E_{p_n}\left( \frac{z}{a_n} \right)$ exists, has the same zeros with the same multiplicities as $f$ and that there exists an entire function $g: \C \to \C$ such that
    \[ f(z) = e^{g(z)} \cdot z^m \cdot \prod_{n = 1}^{\infty} E_{p_n}\left( \frac{z}{a_n} \right),\quad . \]

    In particular, if $p_n = n$, this theorem holds.
\end{theorem}
