\section*{Exercise 4.}

Let $U \subset \C$ be an open set that contains $\{ z\in \C \;:\; |z| \leq 1 \}$. Let $f : U \backslash \{1\} \to \C$ be an holomorphic function with Taylor series $f(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n z^n$ at 0. Suppose that $f$ has a simple pole at 1. Prove that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \dfrac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = 1$.

\textbf{Solution:}

If there is a simple pole at $1$, then, for $\lambda \neq 0$, $f$ can be written as follows
\[ f(z) = \frac{\lambda}{1-z} + h(z), \]
where $h: U \to \C$ is holomorphic with Taylor series $h(z) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} b_k z^k$. Then, when $|z| < 1$, we have that
\[ f(z) = \lambda \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} z^k + \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} b_k z^k = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} z^k \left( \lambda + b_k \right). \]
The Taylor series expansion is unique, and thus, it follows that
\[ a_n = \lambda + b_n, \]
Note that $h$ is holomorphic at $1$, so $h$ doesn't have any singularity at $\{ z\in \C \;:\; |z| \leq 1 \}$. Thus, the radius of convergence of the Taylor series, which we proved previously that is the distance from the center of the series to the nearest non-removable singularity, is greater than 1. It follows that, $|h(1)| = \left| \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} b_k \right| \leq \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} |b_k| < \infty$ so we conclude that $b_n \overset{n\to\infty}{\to} 0$.

Finally,
\[ \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{\lambda + b_{k+1}}{\lambda + b_{k}} = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda} = 1. \]
