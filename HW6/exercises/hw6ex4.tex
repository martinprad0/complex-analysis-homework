\section*{Exercise 4.}

Let $0 \leq r < R,\; z_0 \in \C$ and let $f$ be a holomorphic function in the ring $A = \{r < | z-z_0 | < R\}$ with Laurent series $f(z) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} c_n (z-z_0)^n$. Suppose that $f$ has an antiderivative in $A$. Show that $c_{-1} = 0$.

\textbf{Solution:}

Let $\gamma \subseteq A$ be the following curve $\gamma(t) = \rho e^{2\pi i t}$ for $\rho \in (r, R)$, and let $g_1$ be function such that $f(z) = g_1'(z)$ for $z \in A$. 

Now let $h(z) = \sum_{n = -\infty, n \neq -1}^{\infty} c_n (z-z_0)^n$ which has antiderivative
\[ g_2 (z) = \sum_{n = -\infty, n \neq -1}^{\infty} \frac{c_n}{n+1} (z-z_0)^{n+1}. \]
Both functions $h(z)$ and $g_2(z)$ are defined in $A$ because $h(z) = f(z) - c_{-1}(z-z_0)^{-1}$, and by absolute convergence, for every $\rho \in (r, R)$ and $|z-z_0| = \rho$,
\[ |g_2(z)| \leq  \sum_{n = -\infty, n \neq -1}^{\infty} \frac{c_n}{n+1} \rho^{n+1} \leq \rho \sum_{n = -\infty, n \neq -1}^{\infty} c_n \rho^{n} < \infty. \]
Finally, note that if $f$ has antiderivative in $A$, then $f-h$ has antiderivative too in $A$, which is $g_1 - g_2$. However,
\[ f(z)-h(z) = \frac{c_{-1}}{z-z_0}, \]
and $(z-z_0)^{-1}$ doesn't have antiderivative at $A \subseteq \C \backslash \{z_0\}$, so it must be the case that $c_{-1} = 0$.
