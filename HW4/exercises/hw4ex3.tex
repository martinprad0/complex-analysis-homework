\section*{Exercise 3.}

Let $U \subset \C$ be open and connected, $f: U \to X$ be a non constant holomorphic function and $N := \{z \in \C \;:\; f(z) = 0\}$. Show that $N$ is closed and discrete in $U$.

\textbf{Solution:}

To see that $w \in \C\backslash N$ is open, take $w \in \C$ such that $f(w) = \omega \neq 0$. Then, there exists for some $\varepsilon > 0$, an open ball $B_\varepsilon(\omega) \subset X$ that doesn't contain $0$. Finally, using the continuity of $f$, $f^{-1}(B_\varepsilon(\omega))$ is an open set that contains $w$ which is inside $\C \backslash N$.

\[ N \mbox{ has no accumulation points} \iff N\mbox{ is closed and }N \mbox{ is discrete.} \]

Now, assume that $N$ has some accumulation point $z_0$. Also let $g: z \mapsto 0$, and note that $f = g$ on $N$. Using identity's theorem we conclude that $f(z) = g(z) = 0$ for every $z\in U$, contradicting the fact that $f$ is not constant.
