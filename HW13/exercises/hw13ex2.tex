\section{Exercise 2.}

Prove the class theorem:  
Let \((X, d)\) be a compact metric space and let \(g_n : X \to \mathbb{C}\) be continuous functions such that \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |g_n|\) converges uniformly. Define \(f_n : X \to \mathbb{C}\) by
\[
f_n(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} (1 + g_j(x)).
\]
We already know that for every \(x \in X\), the product \(\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1 + g_j(x))\) is absolutely convergent. Then
\[
f : X \to \mathbb{C}, \quad f(x) := \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)
\]
is well-defined.

Show that \(f_n \to f\) uniformly and that there exists \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for all \(x \in X\),
\[
f(x) = 0 \iff g_n(x) = -1 \text{ for some } n \leq N.
\]
