\section{Exercise 1.}

1. Determine whether the following products converge:
   \[
   \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \right), \quad \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n}} \right).
   \]

2. Prove the class theorem:  
   Let \((X, d)\) be a compact metric space and let \(g_n : X \to \mathbb{C}\) be continuous functions such that \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |g_n|\) converges uniformly. Define \(f_n : X \to \mathbb{C}\) by
   \[
   f_n(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} (1 + g_j(x)).
   \]
   We already know that for every \(x \in X\), the product \(\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1 + g_j(x))\) is absolutely convergent. Then
   \[
   f : X \to \mathbb{C}, \quad f(x) := \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)
   \]
   is well-defined.

   Show that \(f_n \to f\) uniformly and that there exists \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for all \(x \in X\),
   \[
   f(x) = 0 \iff g_n(x) = -1 \text{ for some } n \leq N.
   \]

3. Let \(U \subset \mathbb{C}\) be open and let \(g_n : U \to \mathbb{C}\) be holomorphic functions such that \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |g_n|\) converges compactly in \(U\). Define
   \[
   f_n(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} (1 + g_j(x)).
   \]
   (a) Show that \((f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) converges compactly to a holomorphic function \(f : U \to \mathbb{C}\).

   (b) Let \(z_0 \in U\). Show that \(f(z_0) = 0\) if and only if there exists \(j \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(g_j(z_0) = -1\), that there are finitely many such \(j\), and that the order of the zero \(z_0\) for \(f\) is equal to the sum of the multiplicities of \(z_0\) as a zero of all the functions \(1 + g_j\).

4. Let \(U \subset \mathbb{C}\) be a region, let \(f_n : U \to \mathbb{C}\) be holomorphic functions, and assume that \(\prod_{j=1}^{\infty} f_n\) converges absolutely and compactly in \(U\). Show that
   \[
   \frac{f'}{f} = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_j'}{f_j}
   \]
   where the sum on the right side converges compactly in its domain.
