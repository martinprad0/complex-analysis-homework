\section{Exercise 3.}

Let \(U \subset \mathbb{C}\) be open and let \(g_n : U \to \mathbb{C}\) be holomorphic functions such that \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |g_n|\) converges compactly in \(U\). Define
\[
f_n(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} (1 + g_j(x)).
\]
(a) Show that \((f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) converges compactly to a holomorphic function \(f : U \to \mathbb{C}\).

(b) Let \(z_0 \in U\). Show that \(f(z_0) = 0\) if and only if there exists \(j \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(g_j(z_0) = -1\), that there are finitely many such \(j\), and that the order of the zero \(z_0\) for \(f\) is equal to the sum of the multiplicities of \(z_0\) as a zero of all the functions \(1 + g_j\).
