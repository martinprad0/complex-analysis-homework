\section{Exercise 4.}

Let \( E = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| < 1 \} \), and let \( f: E \rightarrow E \) be a biholomorphic function. Prove that there exist \( \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \) and \( z_0 \in E \) such that

\[
f(z) = e^{i\alpha} \frac{z - z_0}{1 - \overline{z_0} z}.
\]

\subsection*{Solution}

In the first homework we proved that for $z_0 \in E$, the function
\[ F(z) = \frac{z_0 - z}{1 - \ol{z_0} z} \]
is a biholomorphism from the unit disk $E$ to itself. Also, we proved that $F^{-1}(z) = F(z)$ for every $z \in E$.

Now, let $z_0 = f(0)$ and define $F$ accordingly. Then, define $g = f \circ F: E \to E$ with $g(0) = 0$ and $|g(z)| \leq 1$. By Schwarz Lemma, it follows that $|g(z)| \leq |z|$.

Also, since $g^{-1} = F^{-1} \circ f^{-1} = F \circ f^{-1}$ exists and satisfies $g^{-1}(0) = 0$ and $|g^{-1}(z)| \leq 1$ too, it follows by Schwarz lemma that $|g^{-1}(z)| \leq |z|$. Now, for every $z \in E$
\[ |z| = |g^{-1}(w)| \leq |w| = |g(z)| \leq |z|. \]
Therefore, by Schwarz lemma, again, it follows that $g(z) = e^{i\alpha} z$ for some $\alpha \in \R$. Finally,
\[ f(z) = g\circ F^{-1}(z) = g\circ F(z) = e^{i\alpha} \frac{z_0-z}{1-\ol{z_0} z}. \]
