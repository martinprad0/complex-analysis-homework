\section*{Exercise 2.}

Let $U = B_{1}(0)$ and 
\[
f : U \to \mathbb{C}, \quad f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n^{2}} z^{2^{n}}.
\]
Prove that $f$ has no analytic extension to any open set $G$ with $G \supsetneq U$.

\textit{Hint:} Prove that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a polynomial $P_{n}$ such that
\[
f \left( \mathrm{e}^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} / 2^{n}} z \right) = P_{n}(z) + f(z).
\]

\subsection*{Solution}

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an open set $G$ with $G \supsetneq U$ for which $f$ can be analytically extended to a function $\tilde{f}$. In the first place, for every $m\in \N$, $\exp\left( 2\pi i \frac{2^n}{2^m} \right) = 1$ for every $n \geq m$. Thus,
\[ \everymath{\displaystyle}
\arraycolsep=1.8pt\def\arraystretch{2.5}
\begin{array}{rcl}
    f\left( e^{2\pi i / 2^m } z \right) & = & \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} 2^{-n^2} \exp\left( 2\pi i \frac{2^n}{2^m} \right) z^{2^n}\\
    & = & \sum_{n = m}^{\infty} 2^{-n^2} z^{2^n} + \sum_{n = 1}^{m-1} 2^{-n^2} \exp\left( 2\pi i \frac{2^n}{2^m} \right) z^{2^n}\\
    & = & \sum_{n = m}^{\infty} 2^{-n^2} z^{2^n} + \sum_{n = 1}^{m-1} 2^{-n^2} \left( z^{2^n} - z^{2^n} + \exp\left( 2\pi i \frac{2^n}{2^m} \right) z^{2^n} \right)\\
    & = & \underbrace{\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} 2^{-n^2} z^{2^n}}_{f(z)} + \underbrace{\sum_{n = 1}^{m-1} 2^{-n^2} z^{2^n} \left( \exp\left( 2\pi i \frac{2^n}{2^m} \right) - 1 \right)}_{P_m(z)}
\end{array} \]

Now, since $ \tilde{f}$ coincides with $f$ on $U$, it follows (uniqueness of power series expansion) that for every $z$ in $G$, 
\[  \tilde{f}(e^{2\pi i / 2^m } z) = \tilde{f}(z) + P_m(z) \]

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{figure}[H]

    \end{figure}

    Then, this implies that if $\tilde{f}(z)$ is defined, then $\tilde{f}(e^{\theta i} z)$ can be defined for any rotation of $z$ by $\theta = 2\pi \frac{k}{2^m}$ radians for $k \in \{1,\ldots, 2^m-1\}$. 
    
    If there exists an open set $V \subset G$ such that $V \cap \d U \neq \emptyset$, we can find a suitable $m$ for which the union of the rotations by $2\pi \frac{k}{2^m}$ can cover $\d U = \{z \in \C : |z| = 1\}$. Look the picture on the left for reference.
    \[ W = \bigcup_{k = 0}^{2^m - 1} e^{2\pi \frac{k}{2^m}} V \supseteq \d B_1(0). \]
\end{multicols}

Finally, this implies that since $W$ is open and $1\in W$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $G \supseteq B_{1+\varepsilon}(0)$. Since the power series expansion of $\tilde{f}$ is the same for $f$, this would imply that the radius of convergence of the power series of $\tilde{f}$ is strictly greater than 1. But this is a contradiction to the fact that the ratio test gives us radius of convergence equal to 1 for $f$.
