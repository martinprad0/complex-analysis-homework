\section{Exercise 5.} Does there exist a homeomorphic function $\C \to \E$?

\subsection*{Solution}

Note that the function $f(x) = \frac{x}{1-|x|} $ is a bijection between $(0,1)$ and $(0,\infty)$ with inverse $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{1+|x|}$. In fact, if $x < y$, then
\[ 1-|x| > 1-|y| \implies \frac{1}{1-|x|} < \frac{1}{1-|y|} \implies f(x) < f(y) \]
On the other hand, for $x \in (0,\infty)$, since $|x| = x$ and $\left| \frac{x}{1+x} \right| = \frac{x}{1+x}$, it follows that
\[ f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\left( \frac{x}{1+x} \right) = \frac{\frac{x}{1+x}}{1- \frac{x}{1+x}} = \frac{x}{1-x} = \frac{\frac{x}{1+x}}{\frac{1+x-x}{1+x}} = x. \]
Therefore, $f$ is surjective too.

Now, when we extend to the complex plane with $|\cdot|$ being the module function,
\[ f(e^{i\theta} x) = \frac{e^{i\theta} x}{1 - |e^{i\theta} x|} = e^{i\theta}\frac{ x}{1 - |x|} = e^{i\theta} f(x). \]
Therefore, $f(z)$ is a bijection between $e^{i\theta} (0,1)$ and $e^{i\theta} (0,\infty)$ and $f(0) = 0$. Therefore, after joining all the domains, we obtain that
\[ f(z) = \frac{z}{1-|z|} \]
is a bijection between $B_1(0)$ and $\C$ and it's continuous because is a composition of continuous functions. Therefore, $f$ is a homeomorphism.
